{"risks":["AI accuracy & trust: buyers will reject auto-extracted requirements unless provenance, confidence indicators, and easy edit/human-in-loop flows exist—80% acceptance target is optimistic.","Integration & engineering complexity: reliable bi-directional sync with Jira/Confluence/GitHub and flexible field mappings are hard and will gate engineering buy-in and adoption.","Security, privacy & regulatory hurdles: recording/transcription, data residency, consent laws (one- vs two‑party), HIPAA/financial regulations and vendor risk reviews lengthen sales cycles.","Over-scoped MVP & capital intensity: building enterprise features (SOC2, multi-tenant isolation, speaker ID, advanced analytics) too early will delay pilots and burn runway.","Behavioral adoption friction: stakeholders are entrenched in email/Slack/meetings—must deliver clear time-savings and low-friction access (no new login) to change habits.","Go-to-market fragmentation: multiple buyer personas (PMs, BAs, UX researchers, PMOs) without a focused ICP risks slow acquisition and inefficient sales.","Liability & downstream risk: incorrect or incomplete AI-extracted requirements could lead to implementation defects or compliance exposure if not properly governed."],"goNoGo":"caution","summary":"The research concludes there is a credible market opportunity for a chat-first, AI-assisted requirements platform that converts stakeholder conversations into editable, traceable requirement artifacts and exports to issue trackers. Pain is real and common (scattered requirements, poor traceability, long feedback loops), buyers in mid-market SaaS, regulated industries and consultancies have willingness to pay, and macro trends (generative AI copilots, asynchronous collaboration, and demand for provenance/auditability) create a favorable timing window. TAM estimates cluster around ~$8B with a realistic SAM near $1.6B and a 3-year SOM of $8–18M for a focused go-to-market.\n\nHowever PMF is plausible but not yet proven (pmfScore = 6). The product bundles technically and commercially challenging capabilities into an MVP (high‑quality AI extraction, enterprise integrations, security/compliance, optional recording/speaker ID, approval workflows). Adoption hinges on AI accuracy and trust, robust two‑way integrations (Jira/Confluence/Docs), low-friction async stakeholder access, and enterprise-grade security/compliance. Execution risks—model hallucination, integration complexity, procurement gating, and over-scoping—mean the team must be disciplined on ICP, MVP scope, and pilot design to prove value quickly.","nextSteps":["Lock a narrow ICP and pilot template: target mid-market SaaS product teams (50–500 employees) and regulated digital teams (healthcare/fintech) for initial pilots—document 2–3 vertical templates (API, clinical, UX) for immediate use.","Define a laser-focused MVP (deliver in 3–6 months): must-haves only – guided chat interview engine (branching, async), editable AI-assisted extraction with visible provenance and confidence, structured requirement cards, one-way export to Jira + export to DOCX/CSV, stakeholder invite flows (secure expiring links), and SSO + basic encryption. Defer recording/speaker-ID, multi-issue sync, advanced analytics and e-signature to later phases.","Build human-in-the-loop extraction UX & provenance: design UI that shows transcript->requirement links, confidence scores, edit controls, and source quoting; require explicit human acceptance step before exporting to trackers.","Ship integration-first engineering sprint: implement robust, well-documented Jira and Confluence (or Google Docs) connectors first; include webhooks, field-mapping UI, and a one-way export to validate developer handoffs before investing in full two-way sync.","Run paid, metric-driven pilots (3–6 pilots initially): require measurable goals (e.g., reduce time-to-first-draft by X% — target 20–40%, async completion >=75%, and >=70% AI suggestion acceptance). Use paid pilots with short contractual terms and success milestones to prove ROI and de-risk procurement objections.","Stand-up security & compliance program: prioritize SSO/SCIM, encryption at rest/in transit, audit logs, per-session consent capture, retention policy configs, and a roadmap to SOC2 readiness. Create a compliance checklist and pilot-friendly contractual templates (data processing addendum, BAA where needed).","Establish ModelOps & data governance: plan for labeling, retraining, human feedback loops, explainability docs and an incident/rollback process for hallucinations; instrument AI output acceptance/rejection for continuous improvement.","Create baseline instrumentation & measurement playbook: require pilot customers to capture pre-pilot baselines (time-to-first-draft, number of clarification tickets, stakeholder response rates) and define success metrics and dashboards to prove value.","Go-to-market & pricing: pilot sale motion (solutions engineering + AE) for mid-market; price as paid pilots with project + editor seat model and free external stakeholder access. Prepare partner outreach to Atlassian Marketplace consultancies and Agile coaches to seed trials.","Set go/no-go milestones and timeline: define 3-month delivery checkpoints (MVP build, first integrations, closed beta), pilot conversion targets (e.g., 20 pilots initiated, 30% conversion to paid within 6 months), and a security milestone (SSO + audit logs) required before enterprise sales. Reassess ‘go’ if AI acceptance >=70% in pilots, integrations are stable for 2 reference accounts, and at least two paid pilots report measurable ROI."],"strengths":["Addresses a clear, costly pain: scattered conversations → slow, error-prone requirements work that teams want to reduce.","Strong macro tailwinds: generative AI copilots and rising demand for asynchronous collaboration lower adoption friction for chat-first workflows.","Differentiated positioning: combines low-friction guided interviews + provenance-linked, requirement-grade outputs and approvals—occupies a space incumbents don’t serve well.","Large addressable market with a realizable SAM: TAM ~$8B, SAM ~$1.6B focused on NA/EU mid-market & regulated segments.","High-priority, high-impact core features: guided interview engine, AI-assisted extraction (human-in-loop), structured requirement cards, and deep Jira/Confluence integrations are urgently needed by buyers.","Multiple commercialization levers: paid proof-of-value pilots, template marketplace, and channel partnerships (Atlassian partners, consultancies) to accelerate trials and trust."]}
