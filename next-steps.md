# Next Steps

This repository was generated by **Innovation Flow**. Follow the checklist below to get it running.

## Pre-configured (already set in Vercel)

The following have been automatically provisioned and configured as environment variables on your Vercel project:

- [x] **DATABASE_URL** — NeonDB connection string
- [x] **BETTER_AUTH_SECRET** — Auth signing secret
- [x] **BETTER_AUTH_URL** — Deployment URL

## 1. Remaining Infrastructure

- [ ] Create an [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis database for rate limiting / caching
- [ ] Create a [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob) store (or use an existing one)
- [ ] Set up [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error monitoring (optional)

## 2. Configure Remaining Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the remaining values (`DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` are already set on Vercel). Then set the same variables in your Vercel project dashboard under **Settings → Environment Variables**.

## 3. Push Database Schema

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

## 4. Start Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Refer to `docs/spec.md` for the full product specification and `docs/build-plan.md` for the implementation plan.
